# CAPEv2 service

This repository is an Assemblyline service that submits a file to a CAPEv2 deployment, waits for the submission to
complete, and then parses the report returned.

This repository contains mostly code adapted from the
[Assemblyline Cuckoo service](https://github.com/CybercentreCanada/assemblyline-service-cuckoo), and
was inspired by the [project](https://github.com/NVISOsecurity/assemblyline-service-cape)
created by [x1mus](https://github.com/x1mus) with support from [Sorakurai](https://github.com/Sorakurai),
[jvanwilder](https://github.com/jvanwilder), and [RenaudFrere](https://github.com/RenaudFrere) at
[NVISOsecurity](https://github.com/NVISOsecurity).
